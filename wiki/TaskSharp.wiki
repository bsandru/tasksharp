#summary A brief history of TaskSharp.

= Introduction =
TaskSharp (or Task#) is a free solution that provides a taskbar for a secondary screen.
Most free solutions (quite often cut-down versions of commercial products) do not provide the user with visual styles and usually also remove other useful functionality that should be rather easy to implement.

= Features =
TaskSharp currently supports:
 * One additional taskbar on a secondary screen, support for multiple screens is planned.
 * No hotkeys yet or anything to move windows around like other solutions provide, but this should be only a matter of time.
 * Decent support for visual styles, rudimentary support for classic style. 
 * No support (yet) for Aero/Glass and Windows 7 Superbar.

= History =
After decades of fruitless search for free taskbar solutions for multi-monitor setups, TaskSharp was born.
Initially starting off as a Toolbar solution for Windows 7 (PDC Beta) on request of a friend, it showed quite useable results within 30 minutes of work. Due to lack of time and interrest, the project froze.
Soon afterwards, it was reactivated to serve as base for a new Taskbar usable on Windows XP and probably later. Within like one hour of work, the taskbar supported the same visual styles as the real taskbar did, altho the Buttons themselves took another two hours to figure out. 
3 and a half hours to do-it-yourself(TM)? Commercial products are probably priced around the hourly wage of that.
